PUI Fall 2021 - Assignment 6 Adding Functionality to a Website with JavaScript

Bonus Work
1. Point #4 (from assignment prompt’s bonus section):
Using a single HTML file, you can view bun details for every single bun displayed on the browse page. You can also add each of these buns to your cart and view feedback when you do so. Here, I have implemented the concept of “templating”, ie by using one HTML template, multiple varieties of the same page can be displayed using Javascript.
2. Point #3 (from assignment prompt’s bonus section):
Added a toast popup that appears when you add an item to your bag. This ensures that the user is aware that the item was successfully added to the bag.
